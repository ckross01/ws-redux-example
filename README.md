# ws-redux-example

a work in progress example of how I am using server side websockets, node.js and
redux.

## reasoning
Keeping track of state on the server is pretty hard, trying to make it a bit easier.

## gotchas
I am running this agaisnt node version 6.x
It assumes all messages are sent as strings.
